/*
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a 
 * function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N 
papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations 
each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int[] citations = {3,0,6,1,5};
		System.out.println(hIndex(citations));

    public static int hIndex(int[] citations) {
     
    	int len = citations.length;
    	
    	int[] buckets = new int[len+1];
    	
    	for(int citation:citations)
    		if(citation >= len)
    			buckets[len]++;
    		else
    			buckets[citation]++;
    	
    	int result = 0;
    	
    	for(int i = len; i >= 0; i--)
